Pull requests should:

  1. Start with the name of the package in square brackets, e.g. `[XML]`.
  2. Be as small and self-contained as is reasonable. *Smaller changes are quicker to review.*
  3. Include a new, or enhanced, [syntax test](https://www.sublimetext.com/docs/3/syntax.html) when changing a `.sublime-syntax` file.
  4. Have multiple syntax tests and a set of performance measurements (old vs. new) when making significant changes.
